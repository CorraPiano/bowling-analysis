STARTING POINT OF THE TRAJECTORY
Remember that I have to track the ball from the point it touches the lane, solutions:
- Start to print the trajectory from the a certain point after the lane.
- Start when I have noticed n consecutive frames that have similar coordinates.

ENDING POINT OF THE TRAJECTORY
When it is at the end of the track stop detecting the ball

CLEAR TRAJECTORY
Here I have only to allow positions of the ball that have coordinates not so mutch different, solutions are:
- Take only positions that are near or in the bowling lane
- Take a point from which the position of the ball cannot differ to mutch from the previous iteration.

ALGORITHMS TO SMOOTH THE TRAJECTORY:
1. Moving Average filter
2. Savitzky-Golay Filter (Polynomial Smoothing)
3. Kalman Filter (Optimal Smoothing)
4. Gaussian Filter
5. LOESS (Locally Weighted Regression)

TECHNIQUES TO REMOVE OUTLIERS:
1. Z-score filtering
2. IQR Method (Interquartile Range)
