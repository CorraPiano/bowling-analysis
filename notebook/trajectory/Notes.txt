STARTING POINT OF THE TRAJECTORY
Remember that I have to track the ball from the point it touches the lane, solutions:
- Start to print the trajectory from the a certain point after the lane.
- Start when I have noticed n consecutive frames that have similar coordinates.

CLEAR TRAJECTORY
Here I have only to allow positions of the ball that have coordinates not so mutch different, solutions are:
- Take only positions that are near or in the bowling lane
- Take a point from which the position of the ball cannot differ to mutch from the previous iteration.
